This project focuses on predicting the tags of algorithmic exercises from the Codeforces platform using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used is a subset of the original Codeforces dataset, containing 4,982 unique problems along with metadata and validated participant solutions.

Project Overview :
The goal is to develop a model that predicts the relevant tags for a given problem. Each exercise is associated with one or multiple tags, such as:
- math
- graphs
- strings
- number theory
- trees
- geometry
- games
- probabilities
For this challenge, we only focus on the 8 tags listed above.
